    "First, regarding preprocessing, we have a few choices. We have that the basic structure of each preprocessed lyric is in the form of a list of lines of the lyrics, with each line being a list of words\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, FastText produces a vector of length 300 for each input word. If we choose to take the route of no pooling whatsoever, our embedding would be a 3-dimensional vector for each lyric, in which each line in the lyric would transformed into a variable length 2-dimensional vector with width 300. Not to mention the padding to account for differences in lengths of lines, and then diferences in number of lines between lyrics, we end up with an inordinate number of features. For regression, we would have to flatten this 3-dimensional vector into a 1-dimensional one, which could have length over 50,000. For linear and logistic regression, this would not only be an inordinate number of features, but could also lead to a long runtime for producing weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do instead is take the heuristic of keeping everything simple. Instead of a feature size based on the maximum lengths as would be implemented in the above design, to avoid complication and padding, we can keep the final vector length at 300. We can achieve this in a number of techniques, including a max pool of sorts, or some type of mask applied to reduce dimensionality. What we decided to do was to take averages of all words in a line, and take averages of all lines. To be sure, there is likely considerable information loss in using such a technique, but being able to, in some small way, include every single word in the final embedding without compromising simplicity was the motivation for choosing this approach.\n",
